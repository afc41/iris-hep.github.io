## My research:
I work on the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN which provides hadron production measurements of various thin and long targets used to create neutrino beamlines in
order to help reduce the flux uncertainties for accelerator neutrino experiments. 

## My expertise is:
Programming experience with ROOT, C++ that includes a lot of debugging of older code...

## A problem I'm grappling with:
How to leverage innovative software/techniques to existing databases/code to solve complicated problems in both calibration and analysis. 

## I've got my eyes on:
I'd like to refine my coding skills and learn new techniques/better practices. 

## I want to know more about:
Everything! But parallelizing workloads, AI, and Machine Learning are very interesting to me (since I know very little)
